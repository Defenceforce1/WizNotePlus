# Personal-use development checkpoint: phase 150

Development version: **14.4.25**. This is a source checkpoint, not an installer,
release, installation, or completed system-authentication acceptance.

## Improvements since the previous GitHub checkpoint

- Markdown display-math environments and common LaTeX-style theorem containers,
  retaining source text and cross-references.
- PDF equation numbering and internal destinations; separate electronic-reading
  width and A4 export choices, with no remembered submenu selection.
- Export transaction/rollback work and an experimental persistent-recovery
  implementation. Persistent Markdown recovery remains **OFF** by default.
- Local compatible-certificate generation/backup components and biometric
  components. Normal Touch ID enrollment remains **disabled**; first server-side
  certificate registration and native authentication are not accepted as complete.
- Simplified-Chinese resource selection, Settings naming, title-only group sync
  default, and scoped account-page cache configuration.
- Revocable document-read/output permissions across the implemented export,
  share, clipboard-processing, batch, inspector and editor-command paths.
- Guarded queued paste/return, automatic-title replies and password/editor focus.
- Synchronous toolbar formatting/insertion checks, preserving original command
  arguments, encoding and modification markers while refusing stale continuations.
- Image-file chooser returns and plain-text paste now retain their original
  document-read permit across modal/clipboard callbacks. A newer authorization
  cannot revive an obsolete request. Already started file copies are not undone.
- Link-window queries, presentation and acceptance retain the original read
  permit and a separate request epoch. Hide/revoke closes an open link dialog;
  stale continuations cannot consume a newer request. Original URL normalization,
  application modality and one-shot command behavior are preserved.

- Attachment/image paste, attachment insertion and thumbnail continuations now
  retain the original read permit. An obsolete paste is consumed instead of
  falling through to browser default paste. Completed copies/attachments remain
  in the original note; subsequent insertions stop. Image-conversion failure now
  explicitly returns false rather than falling off a non-void function.

- Search-window signals and selected-text publication now retain their original
  read permit/request epoch. Hide/revoke disconnects and hides transient search
  UI without clearing fields or saved state. A guarded presentation overload
  checks each display step; the original overload and find/replace behavior stay.
  Already dispatched searches/replacements are not retroactively undone.

- Screenshot orchestration binds an originating document/request and a read
  permit, coalesces duplicate clicks, and refuses obsolete timers/results.
  Capture helpers are detached and deleted later, not inside their signal stack.
  Restore targets only the originally hidden visible window; shutdown does not
  reopen it. Resource lookup, PNG output and insertion retain the bound permit.
  Intentional hiding must not bypass opt-in authorization. Legacy notes bind a
  permit synchronously after that hide, never when a delayed result arrives.
  The protected opt-in hide path currently stops and restores the password view;
  its future capture/reauthorization UX is not claimed complete.

## Latest local verification

Phase 150 uses incremental/associated tests as requested: **5 distinct groups,
1,081 distinct assertions, 0 FAIL**. The 777-check routing group runs three times;
four directly associated groups run once, totaling **2,635 PASS in 28.60s**.
Loaded retained-runtime mappings are verified for each invocation. No full-suite
rerun is claimed. The last complete permitted run remains historical phase 149:
26 groups, 1,821 PASS, 0 FAIL; it is not current whole-suite acceptance.

The actual original screenshot methods fail 3 assertions normally in the initial
751-check corpus; the intermediate fix passes that corpus. Final routing has 30
new checks beyond phase 149. Actual Qt timers, queued signals, QObject destruction,
temporary databases, PNG files and image-to-HTML conversion execute. Screen capture
and main-window visibility are synthetic collaborators. Native capture/overlay,
whole-client and system-lock/authentication acceptance remain separate.

These are isolated local tests, not GitHub CI results or complete native UI /
system-authentication acceptance. Some page, diagnostic, clipboard-operation and
transport collaborators are synthetic. Unchanged/unrelated groups are not rerun
automatically; wider regression requires an affected boundary, failure or other
specific reason. Historical results are not silently counted as current acceptance.

## Remaining bounded work

1. Native screenshot/overlay and opt-in capture/reauthorization integration;
   search/selection, clipboard/paste/drop, link-window/editor and file-chooser
   integration remain distinct from isolated checks of implemented method bodies.
2. Actual navigation, initial read/snapshot/output and isolated main-window
   integration, including external-editor return/save behavior.
3. Explicit biometric opt-in/enrollment/conflict/forget-local-memory management.
4. Actual system-session/lock notifications and save-first whole-application quit.
5. User-configured lawful signing for native Touch ID/Keychain acceptance, and an
   authoritative first-certificate-registration service contract.

No password-recovery backdoor is intended. Forgetting local biometric memory must
not delete certificates, backups or notes. Known-password permanent decryption
requires explicit confirmation and original/backup preservation; real notes are
not converted automatically.
